Description: This package uses truncated power basis spline models to build flexible, interpretable models of single cell gene expression over pseudotime or latent time. 
             The modeling architectures currently supported are negative binomial GLMs, GEEs, & GLMMs. 
             Downstream analysis functionalities include model comparison, dynamic gene clustering, smoothed counts generation, gene set enrichment testing, & visualization.
